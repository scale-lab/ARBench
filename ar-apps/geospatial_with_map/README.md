# ARCore Geospatial Codelab project

This repository contains the template used for the [ARCore Geospatial API Codelab](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial/java/codelab#0).

This repository contains the following branches:

* `main`, the starting point of the Codelab;
* `step-position-user`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 3: Determine the user's position](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial/java/codelab#2);
* `step-place-anchor`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of [step 4: Place an anchor using Earth coordinates](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial/java/codelab#2).

If you get stuck at any point in the Codelab, use `git checkout step-position-user` or `git checkout step-place-anchor` to check out the correct code so you can move on.
